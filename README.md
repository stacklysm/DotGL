# DotGL

This project aims to be a feature complete, extensible 3D game engine, written fully in C#.

## Roadmap for v0.0.2
- [ ] Add sample code
- [ ] Document all public APIs and important code snippets
- [ ] Group all rendering logic in the Renderer class (explicit calls to anything in the `Backend` project shouldn't be necessary)
